# Cardboard-rewrite
A live copy of our game engine, the Cardboard Engine!

It's pretty neat.

## Supported Systems
Windows: ✓ | Mac: ❌ | Linux: ✓ (build required)

## How to compile

Ensure you have the development versions of `SDL2`, `SDL2_image`, and `SDL2_mixer`

```
cd src
make
```
That's it! All you have to do now is tell the game your game token.

Edit `cardboard_unix` script to change `GAME_TOKEN` to your very own HNID Project Crimson Game Token, and run it.
