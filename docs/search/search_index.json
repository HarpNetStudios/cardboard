You can substitute the value of an alias as an argument by prefixing it with a  \"$\" sign, (example: echo The current value of x is $x). You can even  substitute the values of console variables this way, i.e $fov gives the current  fov. Some aliases are set automatically, for example $arg1 to $argN are set (as if by the \"push\" command) if you supply arguments when you execute an alias, and are popped when the alias finishes executing.</p> <p>There are two alternatives to \"\" for quoting a string: () and []. They work in the same way as \"\", with the difference that they can be nested infinitely, and that they may contain linefeeds (useful for larger scripts). () is different from [] in that it evaluates the commands contained in it before it evaluates the surrounding command, and substitutes the results. () bracketed strings are called expressions, while [] bracketed strings may be thought of as blocks.</p> <p>An alternative to $x is @x, which uses an alias as a macro. The difference is that @x  can be substituted inside [] forms before they have ever been evaluated (at parse time),  which makes them useful for composing strings or creating code on the fly. The @x form will be substituted using the value of x at the time the enclosing [] is evaluated. You can add more @ prefixes to move up more levels of []s, so @@x will move up two levels of []s and so on. Example: <code>x = 0; if $cond [x = 1; [x = 2; echo @@x]]</code> will echo 0, since it uses the value of x at two levels up. </p> <p>The form @(body) is similar to @x, except that body contains commands executed at parse time. The result value after body executes is substituted in for @(body).  You may use multiple @ prefixes as with the @x form. Example: @(result \"Hello, World!\") will substitute itself with Hello, World!</p> <p>@[body] is also similar to @(body), except that it does not execute its contents and instead expands macros to use as the alias name for the final macro substitution.</p> <p>The following commands are available for programming:</p>"},{"location":"config.html#op-add","title":"<code>+ A B</code>","text":""},{"location":"config.html#op-sub","title":"<code>- A B</code>","text":""},{"location":"config.html#op-mul","title":"<code>* A B</code>","text":""},{"location":"config.html#op-div","title":"<code>div A B</code>","text":""},{"location":"config.html#op-mod","title":"<code>mod A B</code>","text":"<p>(add, substract, multiply, divide, modulo): these all work like the integer  operators from other languages (example: echo x squared is (* $x $x)).</p>"},{"location":"config.html#op-eql","title":"<code>= A B</code>","text":""},{"location":"config.html#op-lt","title":"<code>&lt; A B</code>","text":""},{"location":"config.html#op-gt","title":"<code>&gt; A B</code>","text":""},{"location":"config.html#strcmp","title":"<code>strcmp A B</code>","text":"<p>(equals, lessthan, greaterthan, stringcompare): comparison operators that return 1 for true and 0 for false.</p>"},{"location":"config.html#op-not","title":"<code>!

Octree may sound confusing but it's actually a pretty simple idea. Imagine a cube you can do two things to: push the corners at any angle inwards, or split the cube into 8 smaller cubes (4 cubes in the top half, 4 cubes in the bottom half) which you can do the same things to. That's all there is to it!</p> <p>With that out of the way: fire up the game and press Right Alt. This is edit mode. The first thing you'll notice is a faded outline of the face of the cube pointed to by your cross hair. If you click on this face it will be selected, and will be outlined by a solid outline. You can click and drag to select multiple faces of cubes. Press space to deselect all cubes. When you have cubes selected, all editing commands will go to those cubes, otherwise it will go to the cube face you are pointing at. Also notice the blue sparklies in the map. These are entities. They control things such as ammo, player spawns, lights, etc. In the bottom left above your health you'll find text stating what the closest entity is and what properties it has. The effect properties have depend upon the type of entity.</p>"},{"location":"editing.html#the-basics","title":"The Basics","text":"<p>Go into edit mode (Right Alt) and press ` to open a console (pressing T then / has the same effect) and run the command /newmap 7. This command creates a blank map, where smaller numbers create smaller maps and larger numbers create larger maps. Editing commands are performed on the cube you selected by clicking and dragging, or the face you are pointing at if none are selected. Press space to deselect. Point at the ground near you and roll the mouse wheel towards you. This creates a new cube towards you. New cubes can only be created by \"pulling them out of\" adjacent cubes. So if you want a cube floating in the middle of the air, you're going to need some temporary cubes going from the ground or a wall to there. Pushing the mouse wheel forward deletes the cube.  Either by selecting faces or just pointing at them try to create a structure 3 high and 3 to the right like an upside down L.  Now try holding G and move the mouse wheel towards you once. The selection size is now one step smaller. Any space you alter at this grid size will be made up of smaller cubes, which will take more time to render but allow finer detail. The finest grid size is much smaller than this, and the max size much much larger. Try adding a smaller L coming out of your bigger one for practice.</p> <p>Now, let's edit those corners. To select corners press and hold Middle Mouse Button, much the same as selecting with the Left Mouse Button. Try playing with the mouse wheel. This will push or pull the selected corners. Now make a selction with Left Mouse Button. Hold F and scroll  with mouse. This edits all 4 corners at once. These operations may seem simple but they allow for the creation of complex geometry.</p> <p>By now you should have an idea of how most editing operations work. Hold a modifier button and use the scroll wheel to change the selected cubes or the one you're pointing at. It naturally follows that changing the texture of a face of a cube is as simple as holding Y while using the scroll wheel. Not that there is no way to shift, scale, or rotate textures. While it may feel restrictive it greatly speeds up the process of mapping and the running of the game. Another useful command is rotate, which is done with R and the scroll wheel. Experiment with these operations to get a feel for them and then save your creation with the command /savemap mmapname where mapname is some name of your choosing. This will create a file in packages/maps named mapname.cmr. Save your work often! Backups of old saves will be made for you with a .BAK extension. You can later open your map with the command /map mapname.</p>"},{"location":"editing.html#entities","title":"Entities","text":"<p>Entities all have a blue particles sparkling to indicate their position. Some entities such as ammo boxes and armor will also show their standard in-game model, but these will only be rendered if the entites have existed since the map was loaded. Monsters will only render in single player mode. Make sure you're familiar with the different types on entities. To add an entity select it from the editing section of the built in menu or type /newent entname arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 such as /newent light 32 120 120 120. The location of the entity will be exactly where you are, except dropped straight down if it's not a light. This behavior can be changed through the entdrop variable, but the default is best in most cases. You can delete an entity with the delent command, which is bound to backspace.</p> <p>For a DM: Place some \"playerstart\" entities, suggested quite a few of them, i.e. from 5 or so in a really small map up to 15 in really big ones. Place some ammo... remember to not just place excessive amounts: ammo spawns VERY quickly (4 to 8 seconds depending on player load), and not having endless ammo forces the player to move around the map more and use different weapons, rather than just using the one she is most effective with all the time. Normal health items... suggested from 3 or 4 for a really small map to 8 or more in really big ones. The items \"boost\", \"yellow armour\", \"greenarmour\" and \"quaddamage\" all suggested 1 item, or maybe multiple green armours or boosts in bigger maps.

Basically, it divides the world into small cube-shaped \"view cells\" of empty space that the player might possibly occupy, and for each of these view cells calculates what other parts of the octree might be visible from it. Since this is calculated ahead of time, the engine can cheaply look up at runtime whether some part of the octree is possibly visible from the player's current view cell. Once pre-calculated, this PVS (potential visibility set) data is stored within your map and saved along with it, so that it may be reused during gameplay. This data is only valid for a particular map/octree, and if you change your map, you must recalculate it or otherwise expect culling errors. It is recommended you do this only after you are sure you are finished working on your map and ready to release it, as it can take a very long time to compute this data. If you have a multi-core processor or multi-processor system, it can use multiple threads to speed up the pre-calculation (essentially N processors/cores will calculate N times faster).</p> <p>The number of pre-calculated view cells stored with your map will show up in the edit HUD stats under the \"pvs:\" stat. It is recommended you keep this number to less than 10,000, or otherwise the amount of storage used for the PVS data in your map can become excessive. For very large SP maps, up to 15,000 view cells is acceptable. The number of view cells is best controlled by use of the \"clip\" material, or by setting the view cell size (default is 32, equal to a gridpower 5 cube). View cell sizes of 64 or 128 are worth trying if your map still has an excessive number of view cells, but try to use the default view cell size of 32 if it stays reasonable. Note that if you have a map with a lot of open space, there will be a lot of view cells, and so the initial pre-calculation may take a long time. You can use the \"clip\" material, if necessary, to mark empty space the player can't go into, and the PVS calculation will skip computing view cells for these areas. Filling places the player can't go with solid cubes/sealing the map will similarly reduce the number of possible view cells.</p> <p>Visibility from a view cell, to some other part of the octree, is determined by looking for large square or block-shaped surfaces and seeing if they block the view from the view cell to each part of the octree. So surfaces like large walls, ceilings, solid buildings, or even mountains and hills, that have large solid cross-sections to them will make the best occluders, and allow the PVS system to cull away large chunks of the octree that are behind them, with respect to the current view cell. Avoid putting holes running entirely through these structures, or this will prevent large cross-section of them from being used as an occluder (since the player could possibly see through them). You can use the \"testpvs\" command to check how well your occluders are working while building them. If your map is an open arena-style map, then using the PVS system will have little to no effect, since few things are blocking visibility, and it is not worth using the PVS system for such maps.</p> <p>Note that there is already an occlusion culling system based on hardware occlusion queries, in addition to the PVS system, so the main function of the PVS system is to provide occlusion culling for older 3D hardware that does not support occlusion queries, and also to speed up occlusion queries by reducing the amount of such queries (which can be expensive themselves) even for 3D hardware that supports them. If PVS is used effectively (a map with lots of good occluders), it should always provide some speed-up regardless of whether or not the 3D hardware supports occlusion queries. However, if you are doing open arena-style maps for which there are few good occluders, then it is recommended you skip using the PVS system (as it will just take up memory without providing a speedup) and rely upon the hardware occlusion queries instead.</p>"},{"location":"editref.html#pvs","title":"<code>pvs N</code>","text":"<p>Toggles PVS culling, where N=1 enables it, and N=0 disables it.

When captured, it is captured by a certain team. This is shown by the texture its rendered with (red means enemy captured, blue means your team, grey means neutral). When a base is captured, it will produce ammo periodically (every 20 seconds). Your team may take ammo (shown as ammo boxes orbiting the base) by either touching the base, or explicitly with the R key (\"repammo\" command).</p> <p>A neutral base can be converted to your team by standing next to it for N seconds (N = 7 or so) within a certain radius. Multiple players speed up the process proportionally. The time accumulated to N is counted by the server as soon as the first player enters the radius, and reset to 0 immediately once all players of the initial team leave the radius.</p> <p>A base of the enemy color can be converted to neutral in exactly the same way.

However, it takes twice as long to convert an enemy base to neutral, as it does to convert a neutral base to your team.</p> <p>Current team name and capture status is shown above the base using a text particle.</p> <p>At the spawn of a map, all bases are neutral, and all players spawn at normal player spawns, and try to capture whatever they can. Once bases are captured, players will spawn at spawnpoints close to whichever of their bases is closest to an enemy base. spawning will be preferred at bases which are not currently being captured by an enemy.</p> <p>If a player dies, they wait 5 seconds before they can respawn again.

Alternatively,  if this doesn't happen, at the timelimit the team that wins is the team that has held the most bases for the most amount of time (1 point per X seconds for every base in your color).</p> <p>No points are awarded for kills or self-deaths. Infact, no individual score is ever displayed, your score is the same as the team's score.</p> <p>When you spawn, you are given a certain amount of ammo for randomly 2 weapons out of the 5 main ones, + pistol ammo.

The skeleton should use no more than 256 bones, and less than 70 or so bones should be used if you wish the model to be skeletally animated on the GPU. To optimize animation of the model on both CPU and GPU, keep the number of blend weights per vertex to a minimum. Also, similar combinations of blend weights are cached while animating, especially on the CPU, such that if two or more vertices use the same blend weights, blending calculations only have to be done once for all the vertices - so try and minimize the number of distinct combinations of blend weights if possible. </p> <p>When animating skeletal models, you should model the animations as a single piece for the entire body (unlike for MD3 which requires splitting the mesh). In the configuration file, you can choose a bone at which to split the model into an upper and lower part (via \"md5animpart\"), which allows, for example, the upper body movement of one animation to be combined with the lower body movement of another animation automatically. The bone at which you split the animation up should ideally be a root bone, of which the upper body and lower body are separate sub-trees. Rigging the model in this way also allows for pitch animation (which also requires selecting a bone to pitch at) to take place such as bending at the waist, which similarly requires the upper body to be a sub-tree of the bone at which the pitch animation will occur.</p> <p>The included MD5 support allows for two methods of attaching models to another: via tags (by assigning a tag name to a bone with \"md5tag\"), or by animating multiple models against a common, named skeleton that will be shared among all of them (useful for modeling clothing attachments and similar items). To use a shared skeleton, you simply export all the models with the same skeleton. Animations only need to be specified for the base model. A name for the skeleton is specified via the \"md5load\" command, for both the model exporting the skeleton and the models using it.
