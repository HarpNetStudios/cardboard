[Description]
Quake 3: Arena texture set based on many of the Quake2 textures. 
They have been remade (changed) by myself and many more created to expand of what was done.

=============================================================================================
[Instructions for Q3Radiant/GTKRadiant users]

Basic Usage:
Extract the .zip file into your "baseq3" folder.

Add: "eq2" (no quotes) to your shaderlist.txt file to see them in Q3Radient/GTKRadient

>> Suggested usage:
>> I'd encourage you to make your own directories for my textures for your map like so ... 

>> "baseq3/textures/mymapname/" (place my textures under "mymapname".)

>> "baseq3/scripts/mymapname.shader" Add my shaders here. Making sure to edit the paths in the original shader file. (Find\Replace "/eq2/" to "/yourmapname/" (no quotes)))

=============================================================================================
