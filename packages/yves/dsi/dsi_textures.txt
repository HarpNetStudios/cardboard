[Description]
Quake 3: Arena texture set in a basic concrete theme.

All textures are .TGA files to keep the quality up since there's not alot of detail in the textures. 
If you want to save them as .JPG for your map it's okay, make sure you save them at the highest quality possible in the .JPG save dialog.

[instructions for Q3Radiant/GTKRadiant users]

basic usage:
Extract the .zip file into your "Quake3Arena/baseq3" folder.

Add:
dsi_textures
To your shaderlist.txt file to see them in Q3Radiant/GTKRadiant

Suggested usage:
I'd encourage you to make your own directories for my textures for your map like so ... 

"baseq3/textures/mymapname/" (place my textures here.)

"baseq3/scripts/mymapname.shader" (add my shaders here, making sure to edit the paths in the original shader file.)

[Thanks]
Everyone who had kind words to say about my other sets and
the people at the mapcenter forums (http://www.map-center.com)Quake3World.com Level Editing Forum.
All the people who helped me out in IRC #mapceneter on enterthegame

Everyone who has used/will use my textures in their maps.
This is why I make them. :)


[Stuff]

If you use any of the textures it would be cool if you emailed me with the url to some screenshots if possible. 
I really would like to see what uses mappers have made of them.
