Cartel was created in March-May of 2014, and was reworked and expanded in December of 2014.


Much thanks goes to:

 Redon for much help with building and the layout.

 Pyccna, who built most of the exterior and scenery of the map.

 Footknight for inspiring me to build this map with his map "Adstradia".

 Swatllama for constant feedback and help with placing of the items. 

 Briggzy and Death14 for some help in the very beginning.

 Everyone who commented on quadropolis.us and sauerworld.org.

 Lee “eihrul” Salzman and Wouter “Aardappel” van Oortmerssen for the Cube2 Engine.

 The Inexor team for including my maps :).


Enjoy playing!
