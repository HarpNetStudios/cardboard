Sandstorm was created in June-July of 2014, and was reworked in December of 2014.

Much thanks goes to:

 Jiko, who created almost all geometry in the corner with the catwalks and the teledest.

 Pyccna, who also did a great amount of the geometry, as well as most of the texturing.

 Rabe, Savanha, and SomeDude for suggestions in game.

 Nyne, for some help in the beginning.

 Potato, hades, and greenadiss for testing of the map.

 Everyone who commented on quadropolis.us and sauerworld.org.

 Lee “eihrul” Salzman and Wouter “Aardappel” van Oortmerssen for the Cube2 Engine.

 The Inexor team for including my maps :).


Enjoy playing!
