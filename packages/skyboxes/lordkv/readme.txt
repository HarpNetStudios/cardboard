It's about time we stop using the old blurry staffy skybox and get something better. Gentlemen, I give you the Kvstar starry night skybox! This simple beauty contains one megapixel of pure stars! No galaxies or nebulas. And for those with spare GPU memory I have the 2K version with 3 more pixels per pixel!
