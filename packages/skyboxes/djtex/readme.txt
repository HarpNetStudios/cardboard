Three new skyboxes for use with cube engines.

These are three new skyboxes that I have created in my spare time with Terragen.
These are pretty basic, and I'm mainly looking for critiquing on these. However, if you wish to use these in a personal map, feel free to do so.
The skyboxes are as follows:
- isle: an island based skybox at midday.
- isless: same skybox setting, except at sunset.
- mountain: a mountainous terrain, set on the side of one mountain. This happens to be my least favorite, but oh well.
