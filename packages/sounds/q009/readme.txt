Yeah, just put it in main Sauer folder and you're done.

Note that the sounds do not sound as good as in SauerEnhanced because Sauer
doesn't have separate sounds for grenade and rocket explosions and as well
there's just one sample per gun when SE had three of them.
And I was too lazy to create new, universal explosion sound for both of the guns so..
yeah.

Just enjoy and shut up :P
